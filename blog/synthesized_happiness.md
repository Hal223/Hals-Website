The human brain has a unique feature called the prefrontal cortex, which acts as an "experience simulator". It allows us to imagine what it would be like to win the lottery, lose a job, or go on a dream vacation. The problem is, this simulator isn't always accurate.
The "Impact Bias": Why We're Bad at Predicting Happiness

impact bias is our tendency to overestimate the emotional impact of future events. We think that winning the lottery will make us ecstatic forever and that a negative event will leave us devastated for a long time. However, a study showed that a year after the event, both lottery winners and people who had become paraplegic reported similar levels of happiness.
Your "Psychological Immune System" and "Synthetic Happiness"

This is where our "psychological immune system" comes in. This is a set of non-conscious cognitive processes that help us change our views of the world so we can feel better about the one we find ourselves in. This system produces "synthetic happiness".

- Natural Happiness: What we feel when we get what we want 
- Synthetic Happiness: What we make when we don't get what we want

Synthetic happiness is just as real and enduring as the happiness you feel when you get what you want.

## The Paradox of Choice

The most counterintuitive and powerful takeaway from the video is that freedom of choice can actually hinder our ability to be happy.
Why? Because when we have the freedom to change our minds, our psychological immune system doesn't kick in as strongly. We're too busy contemplating the other option to start manufacturing happiness with the choice we've made. When a decision is final, our brain gets to work finding all the reasons why our choice was the right one.

This suggests that embracing our decisions and even limiting our options can be a powerful strategy for increasing our overall happiness. We are far more resilient and capable of creating our own joy than we realize.
