# Taking notes
`2025-03-25 `
The true goal of note-taking isn't simply to accumulate notes, but to create a system that allows for quick and easy access to relevant information. It introduces a new note-taking strategy focused on capturing key concepts rather than transcribing everything verbatim. This approach saves time, promotes active learning, and improves information retention .The core idea is to facilitate memory and the creation of new connections, rather than simply hoarding data, suggesting a minimal initial structure that evolves organically, creating notes for every interesting concept and linking them over time. 
## Use Obsidian 

- **Build a "Second Brain"**: Obsidian helps you build an interconnected knowledge base, acting as an extension of your own mind. It allows you to actively curate and synthesize knowledge, rather than just passively taking notes.
- **Data Control and Portability**: Obsidian stores your notes in plain text Markdown files, giving you full control over your data and making it easily portable across different platforms.
- **Offline Functionality**: Obsidian works offline, ensuring your notes are always accessible, regardless of internet connectivity.
- **Interconnected Notes**: Obsidian functions like a wiki, allowing you to create links between notes to build a network of interconnected ideas. This helps you see the relationships between different concepts and develop a deeper understanding of your notes.
- **Powerful Linking System**: Obsidian emphasizes the use of links, especially "named links," to create clear and explicit relationships between notes. This enhances searchability and the backlink system, making it easier to navigate your knowledge graph.
- **Extensibility with Plugins**: Obsidian has a large and active community that has developed numerous plugins to extend its functionality. You can customize Obsidian to fit your specific needs and workflow, from visual layouts to database-like querying of your notes.
- **Versatile Knowledge Platform**: Obsidian is not just a note-taking app but can be used as a platform for building various systems, including to-do lists, writing environments, and more.
- **Avoid App-Switching**: By providing a customizable and extensible environment, Obsidian reduces the need to constantly switch between different organizational apps.
- **Effective Organization**: Obsidian offers flexible organization methods using tags and properties, allowing you to categorize and query your notes effectively. It is recommended to avoid using folders for organization within Obsidian.
## Use AI

Revolutionize note-taking by leveraging AIris to construct a dynamic, interconnected knowledge graph within Obsidian. Instead of passively transcribing information, users actively curate and synthesize knowledge. Google Gemini's deep research capabilities act as a powerful initial filter, generating a structured learning roadmap with key concepts and relevant resources. This roadmap then becomes the blueprint for an intelligent note-taking system. AI tools like Cursor automate the extraction and organization of knowledge points into individual note cards, while establishing robust backlinks for seamless navigation. The resulting Obsidian knowledge graph transcends traditional linear notes, offering a visually intuitive network where ideas connect and evolve, facilitating deeper understanding and accelerated learning.
