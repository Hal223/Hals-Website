# Base Paradigms 
`2024-01-26`

## Begin with the end in mind
- Begin with the end in mind: It's incredibly easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the busyness of life, to work harder and harder at climbing the ladder of success only to discover it's leaning against the wrong wall.
 [[7habits]]: Rule 2
## The Examined life
- The Examined life: all evil is done though unconsciousness value is based off a things nature, Man's nature is a thinking, anything that encourages reason is good for man, anything that denies reason is evil to man. [[plato]] 
- Place nothing over the verdict of your own mind. [[atlas_shrugged]]
- The moment between my observance and my response. [[mans_search_for_meaning]]
- Memento Mori, You understand mechanical hands are the ruler of everything. [[ruler_of_everything]]
## Repeat empathically
- Repeat empathically. See first to understand, then to be understood. Find points of agreement. Synergize, do not exploit.
 [[7habits]]:Rules 4&5
## Invictus
- Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid. it matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul. [[invictus]]
## Civil Disobedience 
- Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison [[walden]]
- I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away. [[little_dark_age]]
## Serenity 
- Grant me the serenity; to accept the things, I cannot change; Courage to change the things I can; And the wisdom to know the difference. Replicate the beauty you seen in the world. [[serenity_prayer]]
## Mad World
- Enlarge your world. [[mad_world]]
## Hope
- Hope is like a lighthouse keeper's beam 
  Hope the master cobbler of our dreams  
  For Hope believes in desert streams  
  The mightiest of stars  
  The microcosm in a jar  
  Vast or small they all revolve on Hope  
  Hope the guardian angel of the dove  
  Hope a gift of guidance from above  
  For Hope is the heart in mother's love  
  No plans could be conceived  
  No ships could fare the seas  
  For there would be no courage were it not for Hope
