# My First Web Development Journey

*Date: 2023-10-26*

This is my first post! I'm excited to share my thoughts on web development and the creation of this very site. It's been a fun challenge to mimic a code editor's look and feel.

## The Idea

The core concept was to use a dark, code-editor-like color scheme and structure the content as if they were files in a project. You can see this in the sidebar navigation.

## Challenges

- Styling standard HTML to look like "code syntax".
- Implementing tab functionality.
- Making it responsive.

I might write more about specific techniques in [[another-cool-idea]].

Here's a small snippet that powers the tab switching (simplified):

```javascript
function setActiveTab(tabId) {
    // ... logic to show/hide content ...
}
```
