# Hello, World!

Welcome to the first entry on my new blog!

This space will be dedicated to my journey in software development. I plan to write about:

-   **Web Development**: Tutorials and thoughts on modern frameworks like React and Svelte.
-   **DevOps**: Musings on Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
-   **Open Source**: Highlighting cool projects and my own contributions.
-   **Career Growth**: Tips and reflections on navigating a career in tech.

This blog is part of my interactive terminal website. You can explore the source code for this site by typing `cat ../projects.json` and finding the repository link.

Stay tuned for more!
