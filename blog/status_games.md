Human beings have an innate tendency to form hierarchies. These dominance structures are a pervasive feature of our societies, a legacy of our primate ancestry and our need to navigate complex social landscapes.

Within these hierarchies, individuals strive for importance, but the definition of "important" varies depending on one's values and domain. For instance:

- The bodybuilder values physical fitness.
- The farmer values self-reliance.
- The priest values their connection to God.
- The banker values their wealth and the intricate systems that protect it.

Each is correct within their own frame of reference. However, a subtle maneuver often accompanies their beliefs: they project their own definition of importance onto others. By convincing you that their pursuit is what truly matters, they position you below them in a hierarchy of their own making.

It is crucial to recognize that their arguments may be entirely valid on their own merits. Fitness is healthy, and independence is a virtue. However, their primary objective in the exchange is often not your enlightenment, but the reinforcement of their own hierarchical position. When contemplating their perspective, one must separate the truth of their statements from the underlying motive of their delivery.

This dynamic reveals a few common strategies for ascending any social hierarchy:

1. **Rise to the Top:** Directly compete and excel according to the established rules.
2. **Increase Your Base:** Move more people below you, often by convincing them to adopt your value system.
3. **Move the Goalposts:** Redefine what is considered important to align with your own strengths.

Many disingenuously focus on the second and third strategies. For example, a bodybuilder might eloquently argue for the paramount importance of fitness. While not untrue, the goal is often to shift your values, thereby elevating their own status and validating their life's pursuit.
