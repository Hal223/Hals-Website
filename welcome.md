# Welcome to My Interactive Portfolio!
This website is designed to look and feel like a Linux bash shell.
You can navigate using traditional commands or by clicking on links.

### Quick Start
- Use `ll` to see all files in the current directory.
- Use `cact <filename>` to view a file's content (e.g., `cat resume.md`).
- Use `cd <directory>` to enter a folder (e.g., `cd blog`).
- Use `help` to see the list of all available commands.

Enjoy exploring!
